#' @param .sep A string used to paste together additional strings.
#'   We recommend using a distinct, i.e., rarely used,
#'   string such that pattern matching without unnecessary false positives
#'   is easy. For example, when do you ever see `..` in a column name?
#'   Though, the default is `"_"`, which is widely used for concatenation.
