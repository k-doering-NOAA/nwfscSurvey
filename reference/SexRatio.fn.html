    <h2 id="arguments">Arguments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arguments"></a></h2>
    <dl><dt>x</dt>
<dd><p>A data frame or a nested list depending on <code>sexRatioStage</code>
which will dictate where this function is called inside code that
expands the data such as <code><a href="SurveyLFs.fn.html">SurveyLFs.fn()</a></code> or <code><a href="SurveyAFs.fn.html">SurveyAFs.fn()</a></code>.</p></dd>


<dt>sexRatioStage</dt>
<dd><p>An integer specifying the stage of the expansion in
which the sex ratio should be applied. There is no default value and only
values of <code>1L`` or </code>2L` are appropriate.</p></dd>


<dt>sexRatioUnsexed</dt>
<dd><p>A numerical value within <code>[0.0, 1.0]</code> that will be
used as the sex ratio for measured individuals less than <code>maxSizeUnsexed</code>.
If <code>NA_real_</code>, then the sex ratio for stage-1 expansion will not be
conducted.</p></dd>


<dt>maxSizeUnsexed</dt>
<dd><p>A numerical value specifying the right side of the
following bin <code>[0, maxSizeUnsexed]</code>, where all fish measured in this bin
are assigned a sex based on sexRatioUnsexed.
Fish with a measurement larger than this value will be assigned a sex
based on the calculated sex ratio in the data.</p></dd>


<dt>bins</dt>
<dd><p>A vector of measurement bins that were used to bin the
measurement of interest. Passing the bins as an argument ensures that
appropriate "like" fish are found, i.e., if a bin is missing from the data
because no fish were measured that fell in that bin the code will be aware
the bin is missing.
TODO: This argument could be avoided if the bins were factors where all
of the levels are documented.</p></dd>


<dt>verbose</dt>
<dd><p>A logical that specifies if you want to print messages and
warnings to the console. The default is <code>TRUE</code>.</p></dd>

    <h2 id="details">Details<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#details"></a></h2>
    <p>The sex ratio is calculated as the number of females divided
by the sum of the number of females and males. So, the value being
reported is actually the proportion of females.</p>
<p><code>SexRatio.fn()</code> has different behavior depending on the expansion
being performed, which is controlled using the <code>sexRatioStage</code> argument.</p>
<p>The expansion factors in the returned data frame are unaltered for unsexed
fish.
TODO: Decide if the previous method is intended or if the expansion factors
should be changed for unsexed fish too but to zero? Also, the stage-2
expansion does alter the number of unsexed fish but the stage-1 does
not.
TODO: Think about how the function alters the expansion
sample sizes and did not just report a sex ratio for each stage
that could be used in the expansion functions themselves.
TODO: Change the message for stage-2 expansion to better reflect what the
code is doing
TODO: align the stage-1 and stage-2 expansion details so they are written in
a similar fashion.</p><ul><li><p>Stage-1 expansion:</p><ul><li><p>Sex ratio from observations within a tow/measurement bin combination
is applied to all unsexed fish within that same tow/measurement bin;</p></li>
<li><p>Sex ratio from observations within a measurement bin across all years
is applied to all unsexed fish within that same measurement bin that
did not have any sex ratio information available at the tow level;</p></li>
<li><p>Sex ratio from nearby measurement bins across all years is applied
to all unsexed fish within a measurement bin with zero sexed fish.
Here, nearby bins are classified as those that are one measurement unit
smaller and larger than the current bin.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Stage-2 expansion:</p><ul><li><p>Sex ratio of sexed fish is within a measurement bin is calculated for
every strata/year combination;</p></li>
<li><p>Missing sex ratios for a measurement bin are filled in based on the sex
ratio of all measured fish within that bin across all years and strata;</p></li>
<li><p>Still missing sex ratios for a measurement bin are based on the sex ratio
of sexed fish for near (i.e., plus or minus one) measurement bins away
across all years and strata.</p></li>
