\title{Calculates and returns the total number of tows and
positive tows conducted in each strata by year. The
selected stratas are used to expand the length and
marginal age compositions and to calculate a design
based index using the {Biomass.fn} function.}
\usage{
CheckStrata.fn(
  dir = NULL,
  dat,
  strat.vars = c("Depth_m", "Latitude_dd"),
  strat.df,
  printfolder = "forSS3",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Directory where the output csv file will be
saved.}

\item{dat}{Data-frame of the catch data that has been
created by the {PullCatch.fn} function.}

\item{strat.vars}{A vector of the strata variable names.
The default input are c("Depth_m","Latitude_dd")) which
are the two factors the define a strata area off the coast.}

\item{strat.df}{Dataframe with the first column the name
of the stratum, the second column the area of the stratum,
and the remaining columns are the high and low variables
defining the strata created by the {CreateStrataDF.fn} function.}

\item{printfolder}{Folder inside the directory, if provide, where
csv files will be saved i.e., \code{file.path(dir, printfolder)}. Default "forSS3".}

\item{verbose}{A logical that specifies if you want to print messages and
