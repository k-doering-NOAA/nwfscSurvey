\usage{
GetSpp.fn(species, unident = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{A vector of species names. The words can be separated
using spaces or underscores. Full names are not required but they will
increase the consistency of the results should partial matches return
multiple matches.}

\item{unident}{A logical entry with the default value of \code{FALSE},
to match historical output that did not include unidentified groups.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the
scientific name in the latin column and in the scientific_name column
that has spaces replaced with underscores;
common name in the common column and in the common_name column
that has spaces replaced with underscores;
species values used as input in the input column; and
strata used to assess its status in the strata column.

\examples{
GetSpp.fn(c("sablefish", "petrale"))
# Expect a warning because vermilion doesn't have an strata assigned to it
testthat::expect_warning(
  GetSpp.fn(c("vermilion"))
)
# Dusky returns multiple entries
testthat::expect_warning(
  GetSpp.fn(c("dusky"))
)
